# Simple Chat Application using Node.js and Socket.io

This is a basic chat application built using Node.js and Socket.io. It allows users to exchange real-time messages in a simple and responsive UI. The application uses WebSockets to establish communication between the server and clients.

## Getting Started

To run the chat application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application-nodejs.git
   cd chat-application-nodejs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.
